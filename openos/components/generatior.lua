---@class Generator : ComponentProxy This component is provided by the [generator upgrade](https://ocdoc.cil.li/item:generator_upgrade "item:generator_upgrade") for robots. Generators have an internal inventory that can store one item stack of fuel items. This API allows interaction with that inventory.
---@field count fun():number The current number of fuel items still in the generator.
---@field insert fun(count:number):boolean,(string|"'selected slot does not contain fuel'"|"'different fuel type already queued'"|"'queue is full'") Inserts up to the specified number of fuel items from the currently selected inventory slot into the generator's inventory. Returns `true` if at least one item was moved to the generator's inventory. Returns `false` and an error message otherwise. <br/>Possible error messages are: <br/>*"selected slot does not contain fuel"* if the selected slot has no item which can be burnt <br>*"different fuel type already queued"* if there is already another type of item in the generator <br/>*"queue is full"* if there already are 64 items of that type in the generator
---@field remove fun(count:number):boolean Removes up to the specified number of fuel items from the generator and places them into the currently selected slot or the first free slot after it. Returns `true` if at least one item was removed from the generator's inventory, `false` otherwise.

---@class Crafting : ComponentProxy This component allows a robot to craft items and is provided by the [crafting upgrade](https://ocdoc.cil.li/item:crafting_upgrade "item:crafting_upgrade"). The component can be accessed via `component.crafting`.<br/><br/>When activated the robot considers the top-left area the crafting area and will attempt to craft any layed-out crafting recipe in that area. The requirements for a successful crafting attempt are exactly the same as if you would attempt to craft the item in a crafting table.<br/><br/>[![Crafting area](https://ocdoc.cil.li/_media/component:crafting_area.png "Crafting area")](https://ocdoc.cil.li/_detail/component:crafting_area.png?id=component%3Acrafting "component:crafting_area.png")<br/>*(free slots are the crafting area)*<br/><br/>It is recommended (but not required) to use this upgrade in combination with an [Inventory Controller Upgrade](https://ocdoc.cil.li/item:inventory_controller_upgrade "item:inventory_controller_upgrade"). It allows to read the names and types of items and therefore makes it a lot easier to find the required crafting resources.
---@field craft fun(count: number):boolean Crafts up to count numbers or a full stack.<br/><br/>**count** - How many items to craft. I f omitted then the robot will craft as many items as possible. In any case the robot will never craft more than one full stack of crafting result items at once.<br/>**Returns:** `true` if at least one item was crafted, `false` otherwise.<br/><br/>Note that if you specify an amount of items to be crafted that is lower than the minimum resulting stack size (i.E. order to craft 1 stick, but minimum result stack size is 4), then nothing will be crafted, however this will still return true.<br/><br/>If successful the crafting result will be placed in the currently selected slot, or (if occupied by something else) will be placed into the next slot containing similar items or in the next free slot. This can be one of the slots of the crafting area, which would make it impossible to craft the same item again until that area is cleared.
